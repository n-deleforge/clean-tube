# CleanTube

> Version 1.3.1 :memo:  
> A browser extension to make your Youtube looking cleaner.

## How to use it ?

You can install the extension from the Firefox Store : https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/clean-tube/  
Or download it : https://github.com/n-deleforge/clean-tube/archive/main.zip  
Or clone the git : ```git clone https://github.com/n-deleforge/clean-tube.git```

## Notes
- The icon is from Flaticon and made by Freepik.
- It seems the extension only works if you're connected to your Youtube / Google account.
- I do not use Google Chrome but the extension works the same way on both browsers. Just go to `chrome:extensions`, activate the developer mode and then you can load manually the extension.
